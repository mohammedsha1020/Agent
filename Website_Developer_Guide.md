## Customization Options

### LLM Configuration

You can modify the AI behavior by adjusting LLM parameters:

```python
llm = LLM(
    model="gemini/gemini-1.5-flash",
    temperature=0.3,        # Lower = more focused, Higher = more creative
    api_key=os.environ.get("GOOGLE_API_KEY"),
    max_tokens=2048         # Adjust response length
)
```

### Agent Customization

Modify agent roles and expertise for specialized projects:

```python
# Example: E-commerce specialist
ecommerce_developer = Agent(
    role="E-commerce Developer",
    goal="Create optimized online stores with conversion-focused design",
    backstory="Specialist in e-commerce platforms with expertise in online sales optimization",
    verbose=True,
    llm=llm
)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Generated website doesn't match expectations
**Solution:** Provide more detailed and specific requirements in your project description

**Issue:** Missing specific functionality
**Solution:** Explicitly mention required features like contact forms, galleries, or interactive elements

**Issue:** Slow generation process
**Solution:** 
- Check internet connection
- Verify API quota limits
- Start with simpler project descriptions

### Performance Tips

1. **Reduce Generation Time:**
   - Use clear, concise project descriptions
   - Avoid overly complex requirements
   - Start with basic features, then iterate

2. **Improve Output Quality:**
   - Include target audience information
   - Specify design preferences (modern, minimal, colorful)
   - Mention specific functionalities needed
   - Provide context about the business/purpose

## Output Processing

### File Organization

The generated files are automatically organized:

```python
def save_professional_website(result, project_name="professional_website"):
    project_dir = f"generated_app/{project_name}"
    # Extracts and saves HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    # Creates documentation and project files
    # Generates README and package.json
```

### Generated Documentation

Each project includes:
- **README.md:** Project overview and instructions
- **project_documentation.md:** Complete development process log
- **package.json:** Project metadata and scripts

### File Extraction

The system automatically extracts code from agent responses:
- HTML from ```html code blocks
- CSS from ```css code blocks  
- JavaScript from ```javascript code blocks

## Advanced Usage

### Batch Website Generation

Create multiple websites programmatically:

```python
projects = [
    "Restaurant website with menu and reservations",
    "Photography portfolio with gallery",
    "Consulting firm with services and case studies"
]

for project in projects:
    result = create_professional_website(project)
    save_professional_website(result, project.replace(" ", "_"))
```

### Custom Output Processing

Process generated websites for specific needs:

```python
def process_website_output(project_dir):
    # Add custom analytics code
    # Implement specific integrations
    # Customize branding elements
    # Add deployment configurations
```

## Integration Examples

### Deployment Automation

```python
# Example: Auto-deploy to hosting service
def deploy_website(project_dir):
    # Build process
    # FTP upload
    # Domain configuration
    # SSL setup
```

### Content Management

```python
# Example: Extract content for CMS
def extract_content(html_file):
    # Parse HTML structure
    # Extract text content
    # Generate content templates
    # Create CMS import files
```

## API Usage Considerations

### Google API Costs
- Each website generation uses significant API tokens
- Monitor usage in Google Cloud Console
- Set up billing alerts to avoid unexpected charges
- Consider project complexity vs. API cost

### Rate Limiting
- Respect API rate limits
- Implement delays between large projects
- Cache results when possible
- Use efficient prompt engineering
